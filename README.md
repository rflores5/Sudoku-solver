# Sudoku-solver
I made this Sudoku program as part of a weekly lab for my Fundamentals of Computing II course.

This program provides the framework for the game of sudoku. After the user inputs a file containing a sudoku board--there is already a medium and hard puzzle in this repository--they can either play or ask for the solutions. The program can solve any easy, medium, or hard level sudoku puzzle. It uses a combination of the single-possiblity and singleton methods as part of the solving algorithm.
